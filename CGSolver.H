/*@Doc:
        A CGSolver object solves the linear equation, L(phi)=rhs for a LinOp
	L, and MultiFabs phi and rhs.  A CGSolver is constructed with a
	fully initialized 2D or 3D LinOp, and responds to "solve" requests of
	various signatures.  The solve request (implicitly) includes a flag
	as to whether the system is to be solved with homogeneous boundary
	conditions or no.  If homogeneous BCs are requested, all boundary
	information within the LinOp is used, except that the values of
	boundary FabSets are zeroed.  The algorithm follows closely that
	described of p15 of the SIAM book, "Templates for the Solution of
	Linear Systems".  Before solving a system, a small number of control
	parameters may be modified (maximum number of allowed iterations,
	reporting verbosity, etc).  Also, either on construction or via
	member access functions, the user may choose to use a V-cycle
	1-step MultiGrid preconditioner within the CG loop by setting
	the appropriate bool flag (see members/ctrs below).  The MG
	preconditioner used is just an instantiation of a MultiGrid class
	object (the MultiGrid class is documented separately).

	Implementation Notes:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item This algorithm implements solution of equations in a way that
	requires linearity of the operator.  In "residual correction form",
	equations are solved only for the "correction" to the initial guess
	that is required to solve the desired system.  In particular,
	boundary conditions are assumed to be satisfied after a single
	application of the linear operator (therefore, the correction is
	homogeneous at the boundary).  As a result, after putting the
	problem in residual correction form, the entire system CG system
	has homigeneous boundary conditions.  This solver therefore cannot
	incorporate fully nonlinear systems.

	\item In general, a LinOp has the ability to apply high-order
	interpolation methods for computing boundary values.  However, if
	the operator used in this CGSolver is non-symmetric, cg performance
	suffers tremendously.  As a result, BC's should be applied with
	interpolants of order less than or equal to 2.  We do not enforce
	this condition rigourosly, since it would interfere with the user's
	definition of the operator.  If cg performance is bad however,
	setting the LinOp's maxorder=2 is a good place to start.

        \end{itemize}
	
	Default settings:
	The user has access to the following options in the cg algorithm:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item maxiter(40) Maximum number of cg cycles allowed to solve the
	system before abandoning
	\item verbose(0) Verbosity (1-results, 2-progress, 3-detailed progress)
	\item use\_mg\_precond(false) Whether to use the V-cycle multigrid
	solver for the preconditioner system
	\end{itemize}
	
        This class does NOT provide a copy constructor or assignment operator.
