1. Files to do
   - Projection.cpp
   - Macproj.cpp
   - MacOperator.cpp
   - SyncRegister.cpp?
   - NavierStokes

3. F -> F90
   - 3d routines
   - F files in Exec/

Done for first pass, but for later:
A. NavierStokesBase
   - Sync funcitons
   - Get sums update from cache.

B. GODUNOV
   - pull out work array in favor of dynamic arrays
   - look at all the add/sum routines to see if Multifab/BaseFab routines could be used instead

Are both PROB_F.H and PROB_NS_F.H both really needed?

Wrap up for Weiqun
     1. BDS 
     2. ref_ratio = 4 (in advection_setup)
