Included in this run3d directory are sample inputs files,
and the accompanying "probin" files, that supplies problem-dependent 
paramters for the calculations.

There are a large number of options which can be specified from
the inputs and probin files, as well as significant changes which
can be made with relatively small changes to the program files,
especially PROB_3D.F and NS_setup.cpp.  Most of the options which
can be specified from the inputs files are left to their default
values in the sample calculations.

This code is a research code, and is continually being modified and 
improved  as our needs evolve.   Because the list of options is so 
extensive, and the updates relatively frequent, we heartily encourage 
you to contact us directly (email to ASAlmgren@lbl.gov) if you want to
modify the code supplied here for your own calculations.   There is
extensive but undocumented capability.

That said, we welcome your comments, suggestions, and other feedback.
Again, email to ASALmgren@lbl.gov.

As a starting point for code changes: the initial data are specified 
in PROB_3D.F.  We have included several different subroutines for defining 
different intial data.  The variable "probtype," set in the probin file, 
selects between these subroutines.  You may also, of course, write your own
by modifying PROB_3D.F.

The criteria used for error estimation are specified in NS_setup.cpp, 
and can depend on any or all of the state variables or derived quantities.
The derived quantities are also specified in NS_setup.cpp.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTIONS

inputs.3d.euler-f-regtesting

inputs.3d.euler-restarttest

The test case is a "vortex tube" in a constant density fluid
in a triply periodic geometry.  The inputs file is set up for 
the calculation to run to time 2.0 (which takes 93 coarse grid
time steps), and to allow one level of refinement
with factor 2.  The refinement criteria are the presence of a tracer
and the magnitude of vorticity.  In the PlotFiles directory, 
you will find four of the plotfiles which are generated if you run 
the code with this inputs file.  Run amrvis3d on any of these to
view the results.  (We have included "amrvis.defaults" and "Palette"
files as well.)

inputs.3d.traceradvect

Advecting a blob of tracer material with velocity field (u,v,w) = (1,1,1) with
CFL=1.0.  The corner coupling advection algorithm is enabled which means the
blob translates exactly one cell per time step.
