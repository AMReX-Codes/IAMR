\section{The Variable-Density Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations}

TODO: This is just a place holder for a more generic description of the model, which will have to 
discuss the CHEMKIN assumptions, EGLib, etc.

\iamr\ solves the reacting navier-Stokes flow equations in the low Mach number regime.
The methodology treats the
fluid as a mixture of perfect gases; the corresponding conservation
equations for an open domain are
\begin{eqnarray}
U_t + (U\cdot\nabla)U &=& \frac{1}{\rho}(-\nabla p + \mu\nabla^2 U + H_U), \\
\rho_t + \nabla\cdot(\rho U) &=& 0, \\
c_t + (U\cdot\nabla)c &=& k\nabla^2 c + H_c, \\
\nabla\cdot U &=& 0,
\end{eqnarray}
where $U = (u, v, w), \rho, c$, and $p$ represent the velocity, density, concentration of an 
advected scalar, and pressure, respectively, and $H_U = (H_x , H_y , H_z )$ represents any external
forces. Here $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity coefficient, $k$ is the diffusive coefficient for $c$, and
$H_c$ is the source term for $c$. In general one could advect an arbitrary number of scalars,
either passively or conservatively.
