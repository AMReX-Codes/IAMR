Welcome to the \iamr\ User's Guide!

\iamr\ is a parallel, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code that solves the 
variable-density incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.  \iamr\ is developed 
primarily at the Center for Computational Sciences and
Engineering (CCSE) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  Development has been supported
by the SciDAC Program of the DOE Office of Mathematics, Information, and Computational 
Sciences under the U.S. Department of Energy under contract No.\ DE-AC02-05CH11231.
The source code license agreement is included in the {\tt IAMR} directory as
{\tt OpenSource.txt}.

\iamr\ is publicly available on github 
(\url{https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/IAMR}).
The current version of the \iamr\ User's Guide can be found in 
the \iamr\ git repository under {\tt IAMR/UsersGuide/}.

\iamr\ uses the \amrex\ library, also developed at CCSE.
\amrex\ is distributed separately from \iamr\ 
(see \url{https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex}).
