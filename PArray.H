//@Memo: An Array of Pointers to Objects of Type T
/*@Doc:

  The PArray<T> class is similar to the Array<T> class except that it
  implements an array of pointers to objects of type T rather than an array
  of the objects themselves.  As with Array<T> objects, PArray<T> objects
  know about their length, can be dynamically resized and have built-in
  automatic bounds checking.

  When a PArray<T> object is destructed, should only the pointers be
  destructed or should the objects to which they point also be deleted?
  The PArray<T> class allows for both scenarios.  By default, it will
  only remove the pointers.  If the array is constructed with the
  PArrayManage argument it will also delete all the objects pointed to
  in the array.

  This is a concrete class, not a polymorphic one.

  PArray<T>s do NOT provide a copy constructor or an assignment operator.
