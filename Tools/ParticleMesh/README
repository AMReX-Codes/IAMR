This directory contains Python scripts for generating and checking particle and spring files.

To generate a 'carpet':

$ python carpet.py

This writes two files: particle_file and particle_mesh_file.  These
files describe the initial position of BPM particles, and how they are
interconnected (by springs), respectively.

To visualize the generated particle mesh:

$ python draw_mesh.py
